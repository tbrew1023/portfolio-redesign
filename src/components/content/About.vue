        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my site</p>
        <p>This concept started out as a smol sketch, and I really had no idea what it would morph into.</p>
        <p>It's a work in progress but buliding things out while improvising through the design has really been the most fun and playful experience I've had in a long time... Your feedback is welcome!</p>
        <br>

        <b>A bit about me</b>
        <p>I'm a designer who loves to code, with 3 years of professional experience building mobile and desktop applications. I specialize in crafting intuitive and beautiful user interfaces, and enjoy working on projects that involve a lot of user interaction. I have a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end development, and am comfortable working in a variety of programming languages.</p> 
        <p>When I'm not designing or coding, I can be found snowboarding, running, or painting.</p>
